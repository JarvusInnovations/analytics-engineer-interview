# Add SEPTA GTFS Analysis Pipeline

## Problem

We need to analyze SEPTA's transit network composition by importing their GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data and creating a summary of routes by mode of transportation.

## Solution

I've created a complete analytics pipeline that:

1. Downloads and processes SEPTA's GTFS data
2. Transforms it through dbt models
3. Produces a clear analysis of routes by mode

### Components

#### Data Ingestion

- Created `scripts/ingest_gtfs.py` to:
  - Download latest SEPTA GTFS feed
  - Extract routes.txt and agency.txt
  - Load data into DuckDB
  - Map numeric route types to human-readable mode names

#### dbt Models

Created a three-layer architecture:

1. Staging models:
   - `stg_gtfs_routes`: Clean routes data with mode mapping
   - `stg_gtfs_agency`: Clean agency data
2. Mart model:
   - `mart_routes_by_mode`: Aggregates routes by mode and agency

#### Analysis Results

SEPTA Routes Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agency Name                              Mode                      Route Count
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEPTA                                    Bus                       153
SEPTA                                    Rail                      13
SEPTA                                    Subway/Metro              3
SEPTA                                    Tram/Streetcar/Light rail 9
SEPTA                                    Trolleybus                3
```

## Testing

- Added dbt tests for all models including:
  - Not null constraints
  - Unique key constraints
  - Referential integrity
  - Valid values for data_source
- All 52 tests passing
- Verified route counts match SEPTA's published network information

## Documentation

- Added descriptions for all models and columns in schema.yml files
- Included clear data lineage through ref() functions
- Added Python docstrings in ingestion scripts

## Deployment Notes

- No schema changes required
- Idempotent transformations (CREATE OR REPLACE used)
- No backward compatibility issues

## Future Improvements

1. Add incremental processing for regular GTFS updates
2. Include stop data for geographic analysis
3. Add historical tracking of route changes
4. Create additional metrics like route lengths and service frequencies

## Checklist
