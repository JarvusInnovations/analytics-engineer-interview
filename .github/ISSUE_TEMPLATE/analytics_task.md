# Analytics Engineering Task

## Background

As part of our evaluation process, we'd like you to work on a real-world data analysis task. For this task, assume that we are working on a project for SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority), and they request that we pull together some data to inform a visualization of the number of routes for each mode within the system. This task requires that we have access to their GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data.

## Task Description

1. Download the [bus and rail GTFS feeds for SEPTA](https://github.com/septadev/GTFS/releases) and import the routes and agency tables for both into DuckDB
2. Clean up the imported tables, adding a text version of [`route_type`](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#routestxt) (i.e. mode name)
3. Produce a view showing the total routes per mode: agency_name, mode_name, route_count
4. Open a pull request for us to review just as you would working on a team

## Expected Time

You are expected to spend 1â€“2 hours on this task. Feel free to extend the idea of the exercise as you see fit as long as you are meeting the core requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using Poetry: `poetry install`
3. Run the existing pipeline to verify setup: `docker compose run analytics`

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your work
2. Implement your solution following these steps:
   - Add data ingestion script for GTFS feeds
   - Create staging models for routes and agency tables
   - Implement the mode name mapping
   - Create the final view with route counts
3. Test your changes locally
4. Open a pull request with your solution

## Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate your submission based on:

- Code quality and organization
- SQL/dbt best practices
- Documentation
- Git workflow
- Problem-solving approach

## Resources

- [GTFS Reference](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/)
- [dbt Documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/)
- [DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/)
